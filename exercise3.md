# Calculator

## Description
This program is a calculator.
It has been done in two classes. 

The first one is the "Calculator.java" and 
the second one is the "Main.java".
The program delivers the output through the console.

## What should the project achieve?
As I mentioned before, the program includes 
two classes. 

The first one is the "Calculator.java" 
and this class includes the methode of
the four possibilities:
- **add**
- **subtract**
- **multiply**
- **divide**

The second one is the "Main.java"
and that is where i declared the first 
value "num1" and the second value "num2".
I also wrote in this class what exactly 
should be printed with the end results. 

I gave the results of every case ,

- for the  addition **"addResult"** 
- for the  subtraction **"subtractResult"**
- for the  multiplication **"multiplyResult"**
- for the  divideResult **"addResult"**

## The program
While running the program for the first time I noticed that a folder was cereated.
